# Project-Euler

This repository contains my solutions to the Project Euler problems in Python. I will be completing the problems in chronological order, starting with problem 6. I have made this repository to help develop my knowledge of git and practice programming in Python.

*NOTE: In accordance with Project Euler guidlines, this repository will only contain the solutions to the first 100 problems. This is because Project Euler do not allow the sharing of solutions for problems past the 100th problem.*
